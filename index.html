                        Harry James[60] Potter (b. 31 July 1980[1]) is a half-blood[2] wizard, one of the most famous wizards of modern times. 
                        He is the only child and son of James and Lily Potter (n√©e Evans), both members of the original Order of the Phoenix. 
                        Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish Lord Voldemort. 
                        After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort courtesy of Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities 
                        with the Dark Lord. This caused the Potter family to go into hiding. Voldemort made his first vain attempt to circumvent the prophecy when 
                        Harry was a year and three months old. During this attempt he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful 
                        attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the end of the First Wizarding War, and to Harry henceforth 
                        being known as the "Boy Who Lived".[5]

                        Fawkes was also affiliated with Harry Potter and the members of the Order of the Phoenix and was the inspiration for its name. 
                        Fawkes was extremely loyal and courageous, as displayed by his attack on Salazar Slytherin's basilisk and his defence of Dumbledore 
                        during his duel with Voldemort.
